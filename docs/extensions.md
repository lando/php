Note that `xdebug` is off by default but you can enable it by setting your `php` services config to `xdebug: true`. Read more about this in "Configuration" above.

### Adding or removing extensions

There are a few ways you can extend or modify our php images below:

* Using [build steps](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html#build-steps).
* Using your own image with [service overrides](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html#overrides).
* Building from your own local Dockerfile [service overrides](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html#using-dockerfiles).

Consider the example that uses [build steps](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html#build-steps) to install the `memcached` php extension as follows:

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: php
    build_as_root:
      - apt-get update -y
      - apt-get install libmemcached-dev -y
      - pecl install memcached
      - docker-php-ext-enable memcached
```

Note the usage of `docker-php-ext-enable`. Our images extend the [official Docker php images](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/php) which ship with a bunch of [helpful utility scripts](https://github.com/docker-library/php) to manage php extensions.
