# PHP Lando Plugin

This is the _official_ [Lando](https://lando.dev) plugin for [PHP](https://php.net). When installed it...

* Allows users to run various `php` versions
* Serves applications over `nginx` or `apache`
* Runs in `cli` mode
* Comes with easy `composer` support

Of course, once a user is running their PHP project with Lando they can take advantage of [all the other awesome development features](https://docs.lando.dev) Lando provides.

## Basic Usage

Add a `php` service to your Landofile

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: php:8.0
    via: nginx
    webroot: www
```
